To install epc just do the usual
  ./configure
  make
  make install (as a privileged user)

Notes:
  The default prefix is "/usr" not "/usr/local"

VERY IMPORTANT!!!
  To complete the installation every user must do the following:
    Put a line like "source ~/.epc/epcrc" in their ".bashrc" or
    ".bash_profile". The ideal will be to have the ".bash_profile"
    pointing to the ".bashrc" in order to always excecute epc.
    Next copy the file epcrc (located at $(datadir)
    that will be /usr/share/epc by default) to a directory named
    .epc in their home directory.
