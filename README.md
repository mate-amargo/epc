Easy Prompt Changer

This was my first project of open source software.

It was first published on <https://sourceforge.net/projects/easypromptc/>.

I started this as a simple bash script. Back then I didn't know about VCS so I
just kept the different versions as different files. In this repo I've
converted those files to different commits over the same file, tagging the
corresponding versions accordingly. Confusingly enough there was a `1.0`
version that was a complete rewrite in bash script over the previous versions
and also a `1.0` version written in `C` which is the current state of the repo.
That `1.0` bash-script-version is tagged in this repo as `1.0-bash`.
